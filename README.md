For this, passenger has to provide the desired train number and the date for which ticket is to be booked. Before booking a ticket for a passenger, the validity of train number and booking date is checked. Once the train number and booking date are validated, the ticket is booked with confirm status and corresponding ticket ID is generated which is stored along with other details of the passenger.
